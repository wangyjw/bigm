    <title>Java Interface for LTL2BA - Version 0.2.0</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <p>
      This package provides a Java interface for LTL2BA, 
      a highly optimising
      LTL-to-B&uuml;chi transformer by Paul Gastin and Dennis Oddoux. 
      See also 
      [<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0302-9743&volume=2102&spage=53">P. Gastin 
      and D. Oddoux. Fast LTL to B&uuml;chi Automata Translation.
      In Computer-Aided Verification, LNCS 2102, pp. 53-65. Springer-Verlag, 2001.
      Proceedings CAV '01 conference.</a>].

    <p>
      I wrote the original version of
      JLtl2ba since 
      LTL2BA is written in C.
      To learn about using JLtl2ba, start with
      the documentation of the classes {@link jltl2ba.HighLevel HighLevel} and
      {@link jltl2ba.LowLevel LowLevel} and follow the pointer chains starting there.
      The fully qualified package name is <code>jltl2ba</code>, plain and simple.
      
    <p>
      The currently available distribution of JLtl2ba is a fully-built development snapshot.
      Complete
      copying, build and installation instructions
      will be included in the regular distribution. 

    <p>
      Another Java interface for LTL2BA is <a href="http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~bodden/ltl2ba4j">LTL2BA4J</a>. 
      Pending any misunderstanding
      of LTL2BA4J on my part,
      the difference between JLtl2ba and LTL2BA4J is that JLtl2ba parses the output
      of LTL2BA whereas LTL2BA4J takes direct access to LTL2BA's internal
      data structures. The tradeoff is that JLtl2ba should be more independent of any
      future changes to LTL2BA whereas LTL2BA4J is faster. Also, if you incorporate JLtl2ba in any Java software
      of yours then that in and of itself will not force you to work with the Java native interface.

    <h2>What's New</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>
      V. 0.1.1-1:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Minor documentation and license updates.
      </ul>
    <li>
      V. 0.1.1:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Thanks to a patch provided by Matt Hoosier,
        there is no need for any native library anymore. 
      </ul>
    <li>
      V. 0.1.0:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Created the first release of JLtl2ba by renaming the last
        release of Ltl2baIF. The new name sounds better and, at the same time,
        it is more in line with standard practice to tag such a new tool
        with a major number of 0.
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ltl2baIF History</h2>

    <ul>
    <li> V. 1.1 beta:
      <ul>
      <li> Added <code>Highlevel</code>, a high-level interface class based on abstract input syntax and callbacks.
      <li> Accordingly, the low-level interface class is now called <code>LowLevel</code>. - Its former name was
           <code>BasicLtlt2baIF</code>.
      <li> The package name has turned out not to be so final as announced earlier, as it has been shortened to <code>JLtl2ba</code>. 
      <li> Modifications to the makefile.
      <li> Improved and extended documentation.
      <li> Inclusion of a demo program for the high-level interface.
      </ul>
    <li> V. 1.0.1-1 beta: documentation updates
    <li> V. 1.0.1 beta: final package name, documentation updates
    </ul>
