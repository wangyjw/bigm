    <p>
      This package provides a Java interface to LTL2BA, 
      a highly optimising
      LTL-to-B&uuml;chi transformer written by Paul Gastin and Dennis Oddoux. 
      See also 
      [<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0302-9743&volume=2102&spage=53">P. Gastin 
      and D. Oddoux. Fast LTL to B&uuml;chi Automata Translation.
      In Computer-Aided Verification, LNCS 2102, pp. 53-65. Springer-Verlag, 2001.
      Proceedings CAV '01 conference.</a>].

    <p>
      To learn about how to use JLtl2ba, start with
      the documentation of the classes {@link jltl2ba.HighLevel HighLevel} and
      {@link jltl2ba.LowLevel LowLevel} and follow the pointer chains starting there.
      The fully qualified package name is <code>jltl2ba</code>, plain and simple.
      
    <p>
      The currently available distribution of JLtl2ba is a fully-built development snapshot.

    <p>
      Another Java interface for LTL2BA is <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~ebodde/rv/ltl2ba4j">LTL2BA4J</a>. 
      Pending any misunderstanding
      of LTL2BA4J on my part,
      the difference between JLtl2ba and LTL2BA4J is that JLtl2ba parses the output
      of LTL2BA whereas LTL2BA4J takes direct access to LTL2BA's internal
      data structures. The tradeoff is that JLtl2ba should be more independent of any
      future changes to LTL2BA whereas LTL2BA4J is faster. Also, if you incorporate JLtl2ba in any Java software
      of yours then that in and of itself will not force you to work with the Java native interface.
